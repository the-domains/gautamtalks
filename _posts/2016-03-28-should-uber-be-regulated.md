Adam Smith often argued that free-markets were best for economies. If everyone acted in their self-interest, then a best outcome should be reached. In a way, this is exactly what Uber aims to allow. It gives people the ability to work for as long as they want, and as soon as the cost of given up free time overwhelms the marginal benefit of driving for Uber, they are able to stop. So it makes sense that Uber isn't regulated at all, right? It provides the perfect solution.

Well actually, opponents of Free-Market economists (largely Keynesian economists who believe that governments ought to intervene in markets) would argue that Uber should be regulated. Uber is anti-competitive, firms with "middle-men", in the form of call-centres and management can't hope to compete with a firm that links a passenger to a driver in one simple touch of a screen. And Uber offers no security to its drivers. If a driver can't find a passenger, then they aren't paid for their time.

On the one hand, this is good. Because drivers take their own risks, firms such as Uber are likely to employ more people whereas a conventional firm would rely on their always being demand for the drivers, such that drivers aren't being paid for doing nothing for stretches of time. In addition to this, because of the way that prices are charged (higher prices when there's more demand) the supply of taxis is more price elastic. 

But on the other hand, this is bad, largely because of taxes. Last year, Uber paid Â£22000 in taxes for just short of a million pounds in profit  (http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/oct/20/uber-pays-low-uk-corporation-tax). It's because of these low taxes that Uber is able to offer lower fares than these competitors. As Uber benefits from economies of scale, it can find ways to evade taxes, whilst other smaller firms - for example your local taxi company - are unable to find a solution. And as Uber is able to spread costs  across many taxis, Uber can benefit from the app and advertising that allows it to beat the competition so well today.

For all of this, all that is being proven is that owners of local taxi firms and governments are the only ones losing out. Drivers aren't losing their jobs (even if they pick a potentially more risky, potentially more profitable path). However, should we look into the future, Uber could potentially be a lot more catastrophic. As time goes on, smaller firms will leave the market and Uber will have the monopoly power necessary to increase the ruling market price. Higher prices, and a demand that'll be more price inelastic leads to greater revenues, and a worse time for the rest of us.

What can be done? Perhaps smaller companies ought to pool in to develop an app that works similarly to that of Uber's or Lyft's. Or perhaps the government should grant subsidies to local firms or incorporate a price floor, so as to give the local firms a fighting chance. 

More importantly, this demonstrates a fundamental point. According to Adam Smith, Uber should be allowed to thrive - it'll cost us less, in the near-future, at least. But on the other hand, this leads to a potentially bleak future. So in this case, no government intervention would lead to a better present (for most people) but would lead to a worse outcome. And this is where I feel the free-market argument breaks down. The free-market creates a better now, at the cost of a worse tomorrow.
