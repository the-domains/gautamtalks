The Keynesian Multiplier

In the depths of the great depression, Keynes suggested that "the Government should have people dig up holes and then fill them up". What at first seems like a wild idea, may have had some logic behind it. Keynes believed that an initial injection into the economy could stimulate economic growth. Digging up holes and filling them up again seems pointless, and is, except that it gives money to people, which they then go and spend, increasing aggregate demand - leading to economic growth. This effect is known as a "multiplier" effect - an initial investment leads to a greater than proportional increase in national income/product/output.

Of course, in economics things are rarely so simple. Just as this multiplier effect would be fantastic in a recession, it would be useless, or perhaps bad, if full employment is occurring. The government would simply be taking people from doing other m ore useful jobs and having them do these pointless tasks, thereby detracting from the economy and causing economic stagnation. Therefore, the multiplier of any economic activity is always changing, just as the economy is.

At the time when Keynesian suggested this, however, the government was running on a very different policy. Ironically, in 1931, the government decided that it was important to maintain a balanced budget - and so chose to ramp up taxes, and dropping unemployment benefits together with public sector wages (in this year, unemployment also rose by 2%, as can be seen in the graph below). This was basically the opposite of what Keynes suggested, as more people had less money to spend, and thus aggregate demand decreased. Those affected negatively by the increased taxes shifted country, and those who lost unemployment benefits obviously got poorer (which contributed significantly to inequality, which I'll talk about in a future post).

Of course, it's very easy to assume that Keynes was right all along, and the government was wrong. But this is mainly what I wanted to get onto.

Let's assume Keynes had his way, and the government dropped taxes, and employed more people to do a task (something productive, perhaps building apartments to combat the housing crisis), the budget deficit would increase. An increased budget deficit leads to increased borrowing, and thus individuals and other countries have to be repaid with interest. Of course, in a great depression, the UK wouldn't have had the AAA rating it has currently, and thus interest rates could have been extortionate. So, if the multiplier theory would have been tried, then the increase in national output would have had to be greater than the cost of interest to other countries, which is debatable. Someday, the government would have to withdraw from the economy to pay off this interest. Of course, in an economy where the private sector is big enough to employ nearly everyone, this wouldn't damage the economy at all.

Nonetheless, this demonstrates a point I was thinking about in my previous post. It's not only the free-market economists which make for a better today at the cost of a worse tomorrow but also Keynesian economists, who are willing to bet on their being a better tomorrow to improve today. This is the economic attitude that we have today, consider George Osborne's budget, where he accounted for Â£
