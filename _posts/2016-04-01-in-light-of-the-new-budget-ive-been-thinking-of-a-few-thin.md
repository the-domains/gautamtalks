In light of the new budget, I've been thinking of a few things.

Firstly, about the deficit. We're running a pretty large budget deficit, which adds to the national debt. This isn't just a cyclical deficit, but also a structural deficit (which is really bad, because even if the economy is in a boom, we're still borrowing). This can be seen in the diagram below, from the ONS. Here it assumes a structural surplus on 2018, which of course was part of the reason why Osborne was so willing to spend in this budget, but things are fickle. Using the past as a lag indicator, having had a structural deficit for almost 16 years is evidence enough that we're not going to see a structural surplus (and Brexit means that no prediction can actually be entirely accurate anyway). Osbourne's way of dealing with the deficit is strange for a Conservative approach - yes, he's cutting unemployment benefits and making the NHS cheaper, but he's also borrowing more than previously. Perhaps his intention, is that the national debt will grow, but not at a faster rate than GDP, which means what seems like a large debt will be insignificant in the future. This of course, relates to the Keynesian idea of investing more now, for rewards in the future. Which is the strange part, because it's not Keynesian really. What Osbourne is doing is implementing supply-side policies, designed to make markets more competitive, efficient, and thus more internationally competitive, by cutting corporation taxes (from 20% to 17%) and through deregulation. What Keynes believed in was boosting the aggregate demand side of the economy, which could be done through increased government spending (and thus the requirement for running a deficit), or perhaps cutting income taxes.

Of course, this business about running a deficit constantly is strange. Before Keynes, the government believed it had a moral duty to have a balanced budget. Running a surplus meant that the government was taking more out of the flow of income than it was putting in, which was detrimental to economic growth, and running a deficit meant that the government was borrowing to finance spending - giving it the position of the bankrupt. This is one of the reason's why in the Great Recession, the government chose to ramp up taxes. Of course, if we consider the Laffer curve, then this lead to a decrease in tax revenue - but that's another story. In the UK now, we are running a constant deficit. There are benefits and downsides to this. One good thing, is that the circular flow of income is increasing, because government spending is greater than taxation. Also, running a deficit may be necessary, in the aftermath of the recession. But there's a downside too, as the national debt increases, so does the interest on the national debt. We're already borrowing to finance past debt, and in the future, we'll have to borrow even more to pay back old debt, which will inevitably threaten our "AAA" rating, and drive interest rates up. Eventually, today's borrowing is going to get really expensive, and some generation will end up having to pay that debt off.

There's no alternative really. The budget won't go into a surplus unless the current account does, which is extremely unlikely. The world has a balanced current account, which means that if countries like China and India are running huge surpluses, it's inevitable that other countries must bear the brunt and carry a significant deficit. Unless the UK becomes more internationally competitive (which might happen, for example, if the private sector were to become more efficient - which is why Osbourne is pushing supply side policy so much), or Chinese and Indian labour suddenly becomes extremely expensive, the UK will continue to run a deficit - which countries like India and China own, and thus benefit from.

Some people would claim this is unfair. How is it that other countries and institutions get to benefit from the UK running a deficit. This is known as "rent-seeking", and is one of the reasons for global inequality, because economic agents gain revenue without producing anything themselves (and thus get money disproportionate to their productivity). The irony is that the UK has done this for hundreds of years, for example in Queen Victoria's reign, where she took billions of pounds from India. In the long-term, the world has a tendency to balance out. India lost a lot of wealth to the British Empire, but in the process generated millions of workers who were willing to work at low wages - which enables it now to run a surplus, and could in the future allow it to take its wealth back from Britain.
