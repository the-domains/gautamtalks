**As the steel industry faces it's decline, the country as a whole has some questions to ask itself.**

In fact, Tata Steel is losing over £1m a day after its initial £3bn investment in UK steel, and whilst measures have been suggested to save UK steel, nothing has yet been done. Perhaps nationalisation, not dissimilar from what labour did with RBS in the recession, would be a step forwards to saving jobs. But of course, a conservative government believes very much in the free-market. Increasing the economic role of the state is very unbecoming of the conservatives, so this is unlikely.But to address what ought to be done about steel in the UK, we first have to look at why it's a problem. 

The problem stems partly from China. China, with it's cheap labour is able to manufacture steel to sell at much more competitive prices, which in turn reduces the demand for UK-made steel. But of course, the biggest component of the costs of producing steel stems from the cost of capital, and that doesn't change between the UK and China. So what actually makes UK-made steel so unattractive?

There's little degree of product differentiation, steel is steel, after all. It's made in the same way, and the designs are homogenous. What China has been accused of however, is "dumping" excess steel on international markets. By selling the excess steel they manufacture cheaper abroad than at home, their products are multiply more attractive than ours. The E.U suggests imposing tariffs on Chinese Steel, which the UK has blocked, fearing it will lead to a "tariff" war, as countries impose higher and higher tariffs on each others goods, leading to unnecessary inflation and hundreds of other problems. That said, the US has already imposed tariffs of 266% on Chinese Steel. More can be found [here][0].

Classical economists would find themselves in two groups in addressing this problem. The free-market economists would argue that irrelevant of how important steel is to the UK (according to some some sources it attributes, to over 40% of exports of the UK)
