**Econtalk**

Essentially, this blog is no more than an outlet for my revision, collating my ideas in a readable format. If you've found yourself somehow stumbling on it, welcome. I'm Gautam, a 17 year old student in Yorkshire, and I run/write this blog. If you're interested in economics, or perhaps are revising for your own exams, you might find this site useful.

The topics are chosen on a  purely random basis. If I've read something that has interested me, I'll try to write about it. Hopefully my quality of writing will improve with time, so let's see how this plays out.
