Turns out ignorance can be bad. Indeed, I've gone much of this year thinking Keynes' opinion is undoubtedly true. Keynes suggests economic growth is stimulated by spending, which boosts Aggregate Demand. Indeed, many agree. It was because of the spending in the second world war that the depression was cut short, and it might be essential in a recession. This justifies the low interest rates and quantitative easing the UK has seen over the past few years, to fully enable the economy to recover.

However, Hayek has an alternative view. Spending leads to both firms and consumers "over consuming", spending more and perhaps irrationally. Firms may believe that demand for their goods has gone up in the long-run as a result, and thus increase output significantly - leading to an increase in the price of fixed costs - often by borrowing because interest rates become low. However, these low interest rates are only temporary and whatever money is released into the economy will bring about a rise in inflation such that these consumers may decrease consumptions, which thereby leads to a fall in revenue for firms - and thereby decrease their power to pay back their loans - forcing them to declare bankruptcy and fail to repay their loans.

Of course, as loans are not paid back - this leads to a fall in the availability of credit, and thus a rise in interest rates (as banks look to accommodate the increase risk of failed loans) - which decrease aggregate demand once more, plunging the economy right back into a negative output gap. Hayek, therefore, very much fears the economic cycle - and argues that expansionary monetary policy can oft be more damaging than helpful.

The flaw with Hayek's argument comes in the idea of moral haz
