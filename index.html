&quot;Firstly, about the deficit. We&#x27;re running a pretty large budget deficit, which adds to the national debt. This isn&#x27;t just a cyclical deficit, but also a structural deficit (which is really bad, because even if the economy is in a boom, we&#x27;re still borrowing). This can be seen in the diagram below, from the ONS. Here it assumes a structural surplus on 2018, which of course was part of the reason why Osborne was so willing to spend in this budget, but things are fickle. Using the past as a lag indicator, having had a structural deficit for almost 16 years is evidence enough that we&#x27;re not going to see a structural surplus (and Brexit means that no prediction can actually be entirely accurate anyway). Osbourne&#x27;s way of dealing with the deficit is strange for a Conservative approach - yes, he&#x27;s cutting unemployment benefits and making the NHS cheaper, but he&#x27;s also borrowing more than previously. Perhaps his intention, is that the national debt will grow, but not at a faster rate than GDP, which means what seems like a large debt will be insignificant in the future. This of course, relates to the Keynesian idea of investing more now, for rewards in the future. Which is the strange part, because it&#x27;s not Keynesian really. What Osbourne is doing is implementing supply-side policies, designed to make markets more competitive, efficient, and thus more internationally competitive, by cutting corporation taxes (from 20% to 17%) and through deregulation. What Keynes believed in was boosting the aggregate demand side of the economy, which could be done through increased government spending (and thus the requirement for running a deficit), or perhaps cutting income taxes.&quot;, &quot;_html&quot;: &quot;&lt;p&gt;Firstly, about the deficit.
