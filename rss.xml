            <title><![CDATA[Keynes vs Hayek]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Keynes vs Hayek</h1><p>Turns out ignorance can be bad. Indeed, I've gone much of this year thinking Keynes' opinion is undoubtedly true. Keynes suggests economic growth is stimulated by spending, which boosts Aggregate Demand. Indeed, many agree. It was because of the spending in the second world war that the depression was cut short, and it might be essential in a recession. This justifies the low interest rates and quantitative easing the UK has seen over the past few years, to fully enable the economy to recover.</p></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Should Uber be Regulated?]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Adam Smith often argued that free-markets were best for economies. If everyone acted in their self-interest, then a best outcome should be reached. In a way, this is exactly what Uber aims to allow. It gives people the ability to work for as long as they want, and as soon as the cost of given up free time overwhelms the marginal benefit of driving for Uber, they are able to stop. So it makes sense that Uber isn't regulated at all, right? It provides the perfect solution.</p>]]></description>
